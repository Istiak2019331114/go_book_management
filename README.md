# Go Book Management API with JWT Authentication

This is a REST API for managing books and authors built with Go.  
It now includes JWT-based authentication to protect modification routes.

---

## Features

- User login with JWT token issued in an HTTP-only cookie  
- Public endpoints for retrieving books and authors  
- Protected endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting books (require JWT auth)  
- Middleware to verify JWT token on protected routes  

---

## Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-book-management.git
cd go-book-management
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Run the server:

Server listens on port `3000`.

---

## Authentication

* POST `/login` with JSON body:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "whoami"
  }
  ```

* On success, a JWT token cookie named `token` is set (HttpOnly).

* Use this cookie in subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

* Token expires in 1 hour.
